	<h2>Gran Premio Alcobendas</h2>
<article class="columnb">
	<div class="container">
           <p>Continuing my education in the Spanish amateur racing scene, I did another circuit race yesterday in the Madrid suburb of Alcobendas. Another well-run race that mirrors the finest US racing tradition of riding around in an anonymous industrial park.</p>
<p>The course was a back-and-forth loop through several traffic circles. It was actually a pretty long loop--about three miles total--and had a gentler V-shaped profile. Fortunately the two turn around points were actual traffic circles. One of the biggest factors in this race, aside from the European ex-pros (more on that later), was going to be the unrelenting sun and lack of shade. About 70 or so of us line up for the combined 30/40 field. Unsurprisingly, several team cars line up behind the ambulance that trails the pack. By now I&#39;ve come to expect this level of sophistication/intensity despite the laid-back attitude you&#39;d expect from racers of a certain age....</p>
<p>Gun goes off and I&#39;m positioned well in the pack, crusing along comfortably with the pretty high pace, even accidentally getting on to the very front at one point during the long climb on one of the laps. I&#39;m thinking this is going to be a better race for me than the first one I did the other weekend.</p>
<p>Then the attacks start.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting a better understanding now of what the pros talk about regarding the difficulty of controlling races that have a lot of attacks. The races here are really team-oriented, and some of the bigger teams were sending off racers to try and establish a break. So I decide to just sit in and let this attacking business sort itself out. It turns out in a race like this where there&#39;s actual racing, the pack isn&#39;t content to sit back and just let a break get established. They&#39;re making these guys out front work for it. And the first few failed attacks are basically the result of our even higher-speed pack. Every attack results in a corresponding increase in our speed. I&#39;m on the rivet just trying to hang on. Eventually I lose contact and that&#39;s that. Unfortunately, it looks like not long after I drop off, a break of five actually gets away and the pack settles down. If I could have just held on a little longer, I might have had a more successful outing. I&#39;m not the only one this happened to; at least half the field is gone by the end.</p>
<p>No matter, still a fun outing, only 15 euros total, and I got some good racing in. As I was searching around on the websites of some of the more prominent teams around here, I discovered that some of them have ex-pros riding on them. Guys from Caja Rural and other Pro Continental teams who just missed making the roster this year, biding their time for the next contract. These are the guys I have to race with; there are no Categories 1 through 5. Racing in Spain is more or less age-graded, with a few exceptions. So no 3/4 35+ racing for me for a few years!</p>
