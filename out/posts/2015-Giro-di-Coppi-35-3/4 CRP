Great day everyone.  Thanks to Danny and everyone who made it happen.

 

We had fun in the 3/4 Masters race.  Me, Kevin – wait, this isn’t a crit – Gallo, David – the beast – Wilson, Greg – the crusher of souls – Butler, and the defending champion, el presidente, Bill Cusmano.

 

In pre-race emails we made various excuses for why we weren’t going to be the “guy” – mine is I’m building for Cyclocross and have not done any intensity.  Last year I got dropped on lap 1.

 

On lap 1, I was comfortably staying around 3-5th wheel, but David was doing way too much work.  He was super strong, and the other teams were using him. I rolled up and told him, but then about mid-course, before old Baltimore, I decided to just roll off the front myself maybe give David a break and get things going (this was about 20 minutes into the race – what the HELL was I thinking).  I really just pedaled hard off the front and hoped that someone would join. I kept looking back, like “come join me”, but the pack just sat back there, and I kept getting farther away doing just over threshold.  I rolled toward Old Baltimore.  I wasn’t sure if we were doing the KOM again but figured what the hell I’d go for that.  The glorious solo KOM crossing! I hit it hard up the climb and went over the top with about a 10-15 second gap – WITH NO ONE THERE TO SEE IT!! But with my HR at 192 I just sat up, let them catch me, and then held on for dear life to recover.  It hurt.

 

On lap 2, I was able to recover more and slowly move forward.  Kevin came up and told me my “attack” was something that Giacomo would do, and I must have been possessed by his spirit.

 

I started to feel the beginning of some cramps in my calves, but I was still climbing near the front with relative ease.  I basically just tried to conserve but moved forward.  Got a cold water bottle and drank and hit more gu.  I was staying in the top 1/3 of the pack but more pre-cramp feelings.  I knew it was coming.  Kevin was looking good and Bill and Greg were lingering about mid pack.  It was basically like the beltway at rush hour, crowded and lots of speed up then brake.

 

On lap 3, I was ok, but coming up a climb just before the feedzone near the end of the lap I was standing and felt fine but when I sat down my hamstring cramped hard.  I went from 2nd row to just off the back but was able to pedal enough to get over the top in contact and roll down the other side to recover and get it to release.  Grabbed another water bottle from Jake and kept rolling.  I figured the climb to the finish would be my end, but no.

 

Last lap I was fine up the first big hill, got another hamstring cramp while coasting downhill.  Was doing ok as long as we were steady pedaling.  But when we got to Old Baltimore my legs just wouldn’t push.  I slowly lost contact.  Bill Short came by in the wheel truck and I got behind it (I seriously considered holding on to the truck), drafted over the top and was hoping to use the truck to get back but cramped again in my quad very shortly after the top and that was it.  I rolled in the last few miles OTB.

 

Fun while it lasted.  Not sure how everyone finished up
