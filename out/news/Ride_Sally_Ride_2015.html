	<h2>Ride Sally Ride-  Kevin Gallo tunes up his season in the 35+ 3/4 race</h2>
<article class="columnb">
	<div class="container">
           <p>Writing a CRP is a time honored tradition of Squadra Coppi.  Coppi Race Perspectives (CRP) are enjoyed by teammates and racers alike, no matter what the outcome.  This feature CRP details success by describing how Squadra Coppi raced to the podium, as written by 3rd place finisher Kevin Gallo. </p>
<p>Used this ride as tune-up for Clarendon and to stay in a rhythm. I especially like the fact that I can ride to the course from home.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an office park crit on wide roads with a slight uphill before 90 degree right turn and finish line a few hundred yards after the turn. So you can&#39;t wait until the last turn to sprint and expect to pass many people. There was some wind, so a winning break was possible.</p>
<p>Of course, I missed the early break. I don&#39;t even bother trying to go with those because if it&#39;s able to stick, then I sure ain&#39;t strong enough to stay with it. About mid-way through the race we finally started to pull it back thanks to a monster pull from Clif on Artemis. (Even though Artemis only had three riders, they rode well throughout and were probably the strongest team not represented in the break.) I thought people were going to start jumping across, but no one did. Then the break started to pull away again. Finally, a couple riders from smaller teams and Stokely from Artemis started to bridge, so I latched on. Two of the riders died, but Stokely and I took a few turns pulling and made it to the break. We stayed off for about four more laps, but too many in the break were just sitting on.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an easy course to move up, so I relaxed near the caboose until about 4 to go, then moved up to around 15-20th position. Got in the mental zone and slid up the middle another five or so places, despite a bit of jostling and few centimeter clearances. Was in around 15th position with a nice, inside line after the bell. On the backstretch I caught out of the corner of my eye another Artemis ride (Paul) moving hard up the inside. I instantly knew it was a perfectly timed move and jumped on his wheel. I started bumping with Steve from Bike Doctor to my left. I thought he was trying to move right, and damned if I was going to give up my lead-out wheel. Paul, with me on his wheel, went off the front on the short uphill. A WWVC rider went out the outside and was slightly ahead of us, but we had the better, inside line. And then the WWVC rider slides out in the turn! Craziest thing because we were going the same speed or faster and had a tighter line. It didn&#39;t effect us, but it brought down the man he was trying to lead out and must&#39;ve caused mayhem in the field.</p>
<p>Well, as at Ft Ritchie a couple weeks ago, I don&#39;t have the sprint I used to, so I couldn&#39;t come around Paul. He won, and an AV Metro rider passed me in the sprint for 2nd. I finished 3rd. </p>
<p>Hope to see everyone next weekend, especially with the Giacomo memorial lap before the first race in Clarendon. (I&#39;ll be doing the Masters at Clarendon and the 2/3 at Crystal City.)</p>
<p>Kevin</p>
